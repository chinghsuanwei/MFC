It's small project I made when I was in college.

Remember to add new.h and link corresponding .lib to project for newer Visual Studio.

For example:

Add "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.17763.0\ucrt" to other including paths for source code

Add "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.17763.0\ucrt\x86" to other including paths for linking
